Rust and Fur

Team: Bugged Up (Pryansh & Priyanshu)
Inspired by: Stray

Fur, a cat, finds Rust, a robot lying helpless. Rust’s core is almost empty and he asks for help: he needs 5 batteries to survive. Fur promises to find them, exploring parkour challenges and dangerous paths.

As Fur collects each battery, Rust waits patiently, encouraging the little cat: “I… believe in you… little spark.” When all 5 batteries are collected, Rust is revived. He thanks Fur and asks her wish. Fur wishes for light and a better world. Rust smiles and says “Hop on!”, carrying Fur to a brighter future.

Controls: Arrow keys / WASD to move, E to interact/inspect.

Theme: Sacrifices must be made. Rust sacrifices his home and safety so Fur can have a better life.

Development:
This was our first game, made in just 2 days. We learned a lot, had fun, and faced challenges with Godot. ChatGPT and Perplexity helped us debug scripts, write dialogue, and find tutorials.

P.S this game is NOT complete, we had to make SO many variations to our original idea ONLY because of time restraints and lack of skills, i genuienly hope i can ONE DAY make a game out of my original vision but for now please manage with this shrunk down, kind of incomplete but full of heart game.
